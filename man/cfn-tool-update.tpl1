cfn-tool-update(1) -- update stack parameters
=============================================

## SYNOPSIS

`cfn-tool` `update` [<OPTIONS>...] <STACK-NAME>

## DESCRIPTION

Updates only the parameters of the stack with name <STACK-NAME>. Any parameters
not specified will retain their previous values.

## OPTIONS

Options are configured in the following ways (from lowest to highest priority):
configuration file, environment variables, and command line options.

Each command line option (except for `--profile` and `--region`) is associated
with a corresponding environment variable according to the following pattern:
the `--bucket` option, for example, is associated with the `CFN_TOOL_BUCKET`
environment variable. The `--profile` and `--region` options are special
&mdash; they are associated with the AWS environment variables `AWS_PROFILE`
and `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`.

Environment variables associated with boolean options must have a value of
either `true` or `false`. String options are specified identically via the
command line and environment variables.

Options provided via the command line will be automatically exported as their
corresponding environment variables, and will be in the environment of any
shell commands executed during macro expansion. For example, when the
`--profile` option is specified on the command line there is no need to use it
in shell commands using the `aws`(1) CLI tool, as the `AWS_PROFILE` environment
variable is exported by `cfn-tool` to the environment in which the shell
commands are executed.

  * `-c`, `--config`=<FILE>:
    Specify the config file load environment variables from. If this option is
    not specified `cfn-tool` will look for a file named `.cfn-tool` in the
    current directory. This file will be sourced in the `bash`(1) shell.
    Environment variables defined here will be applied as default options.

  * `-p`, `--parameters`="<KEY>=<VALUE> [<KEY>=<VALUE> ...]":
    Set template input parameter overrides. When updating an existing stack the
    values of any unspecified parameters will be preserved.

  * `-p`, `--profile`=<NAME>:
    Use the AWS profile given by <NAME> to configure the AWS credentials
    provider chain.

  * `-q`, `--quiet`:
    Suppress all informational, diagnostic, and warning output.

  * `-r`, `--region`=<NAME>:
    Use the AWS region given by <NAME> for all AWS API calls.

  * `-v`, `--verbose`:
    Print extra diagnostic output while processing.

## EXAMPLES

Update the `Foo` and `Baz` parameters of the stack named `my-stack` to have
values `bar` and `baf`, respectively:

    cfn-tool update --parameters "Foo=bar Baz=baf" my-stack

## ENVIRONMENT

Each command line option is associated with a corresponding environment
variable. See the `OPTIONS` section above.

## FILES

The `cfn-tool` program will look for a configuration file specified by the
`--config` option, the `CFN_TOOL_CONFIG` environment variable, or the default
_.cfn-tool_ file in the current working directory. When this file exists it is
sourced in the `bash`(1) shell and any configuration environment variables
defined are used as defaults. Here is an example configuration file:

    CFN_TOOL_BUCKET=my-infra-${AWS_DEFAULT_REGION:?}
    CFN_TOOL_KEEP=true
    CFN_TOOL_LINTER="cfn-lint -f pretty -i W1007 --"
    CFN_TOOL_PARAMETERS="Zone=${ZONE:?} Service=RestAPI"
    CFN_TOOL_TAGS="Zone=${ZONE:?} Service=RestAPI"

Note that environment variables associated with options specified on the
command line, such as the `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` variable above (associated with
the `--region` command line option), are defined in the environment in which
the configuration file is evaluated when that command line option is specified.

## EXIT STATUS

Exits with a status of 1 if an error occurred, or 0 otherwise.
