.
.SH "NAME"
\fBcfn\-tool\-transform\fR \- expand template macros
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBcfn\-tool\fR \fBtransform\fR [\fIoption\fR\.\.\.] \fItemplate\-file\fR
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Expands macros in the \fItemplate\-file\fR \(em the resulting YAML is printed to \fBstdout\fR, and the program exits\. No nested templates are processed, no packages are prepared, no linting or validation is performed, and no stack is deployed\. This can be useful for debugging\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
Options are configured in the following ways (from lowest to highest priority): configuration file, environment variables, and command line options\.
.
.P
Each command line option (except for \fB\-\-profile\fR and \fB\-\-region\fR) is associated with a corresponding environment variable according to the following pattern: the \fB\-\-bucket\fR option, for example, is associated with the \fBCFN_TOOL_BUCKET\fR environment variable\. The \fB\-\-profile\fR and \fB\-\-region\fR options are special \(em they are associated with the AWS environment variables \fBAWS_PROFILE\fR and \fBAWS_DEFAULT_REGION\fR\.
.
.P
Environment variables associated with boolean options must have a value of either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR\. String options are specified identically via the command line and environment variables\.
.
.P
Options provided via the command line will be automatically exported as their corresponding environment variables, and will be in the environment of any shell commands executed during macro expansion\. For example, when the \fB\-\-profile\fR option is specified on the command line there is no need to use it in shell commands using the \fBaws\fR(1) CLI tool, as the \fBAWS_PROFILE\fR environment variable is exported by \fBcfn\-tool\fR to the environment in which the shell commands are executed\.
.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-config\fR=\fIfile\fR
Specify the config file to use\. If this option is not specified \fBcfn\-tool\fR will look for a file named \fB\.cfn\-tool\fR in the current directory\. This file will be sourced in the \fBbash\fR(1) shell\. Environment variables defined here will be applied as default options\.
.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-linter\fR=\fIcommand\fR
Run \fIcommand\fR on each processed template file, aborting if the \fIcommand\fR fails\. The template file path is appended to the \fIcommand\fR string and the resulting command line is evaluated in the \fBbash\fR(1) shell\. The working directory is set to the directory in which the \fBcfn\-tool\fR program was run\.
.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-profile\fR=\fIname\fR
Use the AWS profile given by \fIname\fR to configure the AWS credentials provider chain\.
.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Suppress all informational, diagnostic, and warning output\.
.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-region\fR=\fIname\fR
Use the AWS region given by \fIname\fR for all AWS API calls\.
.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Print extra diagnostic output while processing\.
.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
Each command line option is associated with a corresponding environment variable\. See the \fBOPTIONS\fR section above\.
.
.SH "FILES"
The \fBcfn\-tool\fR program will look for a configuration file specified by the \fB\-\-config\fR option, the \fBCFN_TOOL_CONFIG\fR environment variable, or the default \fB\.cfn\-tool\fR file in the current working directory\. When this file exists it is sourced in the \fBbash\fR(1) shell and any configuration environment variables defined are used as defaults\. Here is an example configuration file:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

CFN_TOOL_BUCKET=my\-infra\-${AWS_DEFAULT_REGION:?}
CFN_TOOL_KEEP=true
CFN_TOOL_LINTER="cfn\-lint \-f pretty \-i W1007 \-\-"
CFN_TOOL_PARAMETERS="Zone=${ZONE:?} Service=RestAPI"
CFN_TOOL_TAGS="Zone=${ZONE:?} Service=RestAPI"
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Note that environment variables associated with options specified on the command line, such as the \fBAWS_DEFAULT_REGION\fR variable above (associated with the \fB\-\-region\fR command line option), are defined in the environment in which the configuration file is evaluated when that command line option is specified\.
.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
Exits with a status of 1 if an error occurred, or 0 otherwise\.
.
.SH "BUGS"
Please open an issue: \fIhttps://github\.com/daggerml/cfn\-tool/issues\fR\.
