==============================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`cfn-tool` [`-h`|`--help`|`-V`|`--version`]<br>
`cfn-tool` <COMMAND> [<OPTIONS>...] [<ARGUMENTS>...]

## DESCRIPTION

This program provides extra tools for working with AWS CloudFormation including
a template macro preprocessor, resource packaging, extended support for nested
stacks, additional stack deployment options (like template linting, for example),
and more.

The macro preprocessor provides a variety of generally useful, built-in macros
to handle common use cases, and can be extended via JavaScript modules loaded
at macro expansion time (see `cfn-tool-macros`(7) for details).

## COMMANDS

The first argument to `cfn-tool` is the <COMMAND>. Each command has its own set
of options and required positional parameters, as described in its manual page.

## BASH COMPLETION

    complete -o default -C $(which cfn-tool-completer) cfn-tool

## BUGS
